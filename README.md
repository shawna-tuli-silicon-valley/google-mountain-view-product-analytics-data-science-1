"Shawna has taken on a challenging summer project with a positive attitude. So far, she has focused on developing foundational skills (SQL), domain knowledge (Google Photos), and a better sense of the problem. Over the remainder of the summer, I hope that Shawna will be able to further develop these skills and apply them to her analysis, by thinking more creatively and independently. Shawna is an enthusiastic learner, and has an adaptable approach to her work. This is important for analysts, as fluctuations in data and approach is common, and being able to flex as needed can help to stay on track. For example, when initially provided with aggregate data and being asked to switch to country-sliced data, she adjusted her analyses quickly, as needed. She also switched from using Python to SQL as her data extraction and manipulation tool, when realizing that the data was too large for her to wrangle in Colab." - Hide Kato (Google Data Scientist)

"Thanks for being an amazing intern on the team! It's really my honor and pleasure to work with you. Take your time and enjoy college life! (Sadly I don't have the priviledge anymore) 

I think you did an awesome job this summer, looking back a few years, I couldn't have done nearly a small fraction of what you've accomplished so far. Be confident and be proud of yourself, I believe you will do great in the future. So good luck and take care until we meet again (maybe at Google)!" - Shenzhi Wang (Google Data Scientist)
