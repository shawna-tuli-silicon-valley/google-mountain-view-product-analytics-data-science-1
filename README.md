I was a Data Scientist in Engineering at Google in Mountain View at Googleplex. I analyzed 1B+ Google Photos users in 20 countries who take 2.6B photos per day and provided meaningful product recommendations by data storytelling.

"Shawna has taken on a challenging summer project with a positive attitude. So far, she has focused on developing foundational skills (SQL), domain knowledge (Google Photos), and a better sense of the problem. Over the remainder of the summer, I hope that Shawna will able to further develop these skills and apply them to her analysis, by thinking more creatively and independently. Shawna is an enthusiastic learner, and has an adaptable approach to her work. This is important for analysts, as fluctuations in data and approach is common, and being able to flex as needed can help to stay on track. For example, when initially provided with aggregate data and being asked to switch to country-sliced data, she adjusted her analyses quickly, as needed. She also switched from using Python to SQL as her data extraction and manipulation tool, when realizing that the data was too large for her to wrangle in Colab." Hide Kato (Google Data Scientist)
